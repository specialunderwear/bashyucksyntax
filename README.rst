This package will install a command called ``dryfab`` which will act the same
as fabric, BUT!

It will only print the commands it will run, instead of executing them.


Incomplete

Hi only implemented the things I needed myself, so it could be that your
fabfile will still try to run some of the commands.

HOWEVER.

It is easy enough to add the missing stuff, please help and send patches,
thanks.
